2. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.

## Usage

To use the hospital chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the chatbot:

   ```shell
   python hosbot.py
   ```

4. The chatbot will greet you and wait for your input.
5. Type your queries or commands and press Enter.
6. To exit the chatbot, type "exit" and press Enter.

## Features

The hospital chatbot provides the following features:

- **Greeting**: The chatbot greets the user when the conversation starts.
- **Services Information**: The chatbot provides information about the hospital's services, including general check-ups, surgeries, specialized treatments, emergency care, laboratory services, and diagnostic imaging.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: The chatbot instructs users to contact the hospital's reception to schedule an appointment.
- **General Queries**: The chatbot attempts to answer general queries but may indicate if it cannot understand the input.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the Python script (`chatbot.py`). You can add more functions to handle additional user queries, integrate with APIs for real-time data retrieval, or enhance the natural language processing capabilities.
